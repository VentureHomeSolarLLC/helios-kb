# Solar System Ownership Transfer Guide

## When Does a Transfer Happen?

A solar system ownership or agreement transfer is needed when:
- You **sell your home** and the buyer is taking over the solar system
- You **inherit a home** with an existing solar installation
- There is an **estate transfer** due to the passing of the original homeowner

## Transfer Process by Financing Type

### If You Own the System Outright (Cash Purchase or Paid-Off Loan)

The solar system is part of your home and transfers with the property at closing, just like an appliance or HVAC system.

**Steps:**
1. Include the solar system in the home listing and closing documents.
2. Provide the buyer with all system documentation (warranty info, monitoring login, equipment specs).
3. Contact Venture Home to update the account and transfer monitoring access.
4. The new homeowner should create their own Enphase Enlighten account and contact Enphase at **(877) 797-4743** to transfer system monitoring.

### If You Have an Active Solar Loan

The solar system is owned by you, but there is an outstanding loan balance.

**Steps:**
1. **Pay off the loan** at closing (can be included in closing costs).
2. Once the loan is paid, follow the same steps as the "Own Outright" process above.
3. Alternatively, some lenders allow the loan to be assumed by the buyer — contact your loan servicer to ask.

### If You Have a Lease or PPA (e.g., LightReach, Sunnova)

The solar system is owned by a third party. The agreement must be transferred to the new homeowner.

**Steps:**
1. Contact the financing company (Palmetto/LightReach, Sunnova, etc.) to initiate a transfer.
2. The new homeowner will need to pass a credit check to assume the agreement.
3. Provide the transfer documents to the buyer and their real estate attorney.
4. The financing company will update the account once the transfer is approved.
5. Contact Venture Home to update service records.

**Common financing company contacts:**
- **LightReach (Palmetto):** (855) 732-7282
- **Sunnova:** (866) 786-6682
- **Enfin:** Contact your sales representative

### Estate Transfers

If the homeowner has passed away:
1. Contact Venture Home with a copy of the death certificate and proof of estate authority (executor letter or probate documents).
2. We will guide you through the transfer process based on the financing type.
3. If the system is leased/PPA, the financing company will need the same documentation.

## What the New Homeowner Should Do

1. **Set up monitoring:** Create a new account with the monitoring platform (Enphase Enlighten, Tesla app, etc.).
2. **Register the warranty:** Contact the equipment manufacturer to transfer warranty coverage to your name.
3. **Know your system:** Review the system size, equipment, and production history with Venture Home.
4. **Schedule an inspection (optional):** Venture Home can perform a system health check for new homeowners.

## Important Notes

- **Do not remove the solar system** before or during the sale without consulting Venture Home and your financing company (if applicable). Removal may void warranties or violate your agreement.
- **Disclose the solar system** in all real estate listings and closing documents. This is a legal requirement in most states.
- **Net metering agreements** with your utility company may also need to be transferred. Contact your utility provider.
