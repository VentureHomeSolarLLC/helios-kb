# Enphase IQ Gateway Troubleshooting

## What Is the Enphase IQ Gateway?

The IQ Gateway (formerly called the Envoy) is the communication hub of your Enphase solar system. It collects data from each microinverter on your roof and sends it to the Enphase cloud so you can monitor your system's performance in the Enlighten app.

**Important:** If your Gateway goes offline, it does **not** mean your solar system has stopped producing power. In most cases, your panels are working fine — the Gateway just can't send the data to the app.

## Common Issues and What to Do

### 1. Gateway Offline / Not Reporting Data

**Symptoms:** The Enlighten app shows "Gateway Not Reporting," an error, or a warning. No production data is visible.

**Most likely cause:** Your Wi-Fi connection has been disrupted. This happens when you change your Wi-Fi password, get a new router, switch internet providers, or experience a temporary outage.

**What to do:**
1. Open the Enphase Enlighten app on your phone.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Network** and reconnect the Gateway to your Wi-Fi network.
3. Alternatively, follow Enphase's official reconnection guide: [Reconnecting Your Gateway to Wi-Fi](https://support.enphase.com/s/article/Reconnecting-your-Envoy-S-or-IQ-Envoy-using-Enphase-Enlighten-App)
4. If you're unable to reconnect, call Enphase support at **(877) 797-4743** (available 24/7).

### 2. Four Flashing Red Lights

**Symptoms:** All four LED lights on the IQ Gateway or IQ Combiner are flashing red continuously.

**Most likely cause:** This typically indicates a hardware failure of the Gateway unit itself.

**What to do:**
- Do not attempt to fix this yourself.
- Contact Venture Home at **(203) 858-3051** or your Enphase installer. The Gateway is covered under a 5-year warranty and will likely need to be replaced.
- We will coordinate diagnostics and the warranty replacement process on your behalf.

### 3. No Lights on the Gateway

**Symptoms:** The Gateway has no lights at all — it appears completely dead.

**Most likely cause:** The Gateway is not receiving power. This could be due to a tripped breaker.

**What to do:**
1. Locate your IQ Combiner box (usually near your main electrical panel or on the side of your home).
2. Open the panel and check if any breakers are in the OFF or TRIPPED position.
3. If a breaker is tripped, flip it fully OFF, then back ON.
4. **Warning:** If the breaker trips again immediately, do not attempt to reset it again. Contact Venture Home for a service visit.

### 4. Microinverter Not Reporting

**Symptoms:** The Enlighten app shows one or more microinverters as "Not Reporting" while others are working fine.

**Most likely cause:** A single microinverter may have a communication issue or may have failed.

**What to do:**
1. Wait 24 hours — sometimes microinverters temporarily lose communication and reconnect on their own.
2. If the issue persists after 24 hours, contact Venture Home. We can remotely diagnose the issue and schedule a service visit if needed.

## Self-Help Checklist

Before calling for support, try these steps:

- ✅ **Check your Wi-Fi:** Has your password, router, or internet provider changed recently?
- ✅ **Check Gateway lights:** No lights = power issue. Flashing red = likely hardware failure.
- ✅ **Check your breakers:** Reset any that are tripped.
- ✅ **Restart the Gateway:** Turn off the breaker feeding the Gateway, wait 30 seconds, and turn it back on.
- ✅ **Call Enphase:** (877) 797-4743 — available 24/7 for technical support.

## When to Contact Venture Home

- Gateway is flashing red continuously
