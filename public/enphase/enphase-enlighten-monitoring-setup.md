# Getting Started with Enphase Enlighten Monitoring

## What Is Enphase Enlighten?

Enphase Enlighten is the monitoring platform for your solar energy system. It lets you track how much energy your panels are producing, how much energy your home is consuming, and the overall health of your system — all from your phone or computer.

## How to Set Up the Enlighten App

### Step 1: Download the App

- **iPhone:** Search for "Enphase Enlighten" in the App Store
- **Android:** Search for "Enphase Enlighten" in the Google Play Store

### Step 2: Create Your Account

1. Open the app and tap **Create Account**.
2. Enter your name, email address, and create a password.
3. You will receive a verification email — click the link to confirm your account.

### Step 3: Activate Your System

After your Venture Home installation is complete, your system will be registered under your account. You should receive an activation email from Enphase within 24–48 hours of installation.

1. Open the activation email and follow the link.
2. Log in with your Enlighten credentials.
3. Your system should appear on the dashboard.

**Note:** If you don't receive an activation email within 48 hours of installation, contact Venture Home and we'll make sure your system is properly registered.

## Understanding the Dashboard

### Production
Shows how much electricity your solar panels are generating in real time, as well as daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly totals.

### Consumption
If a consumption monitoring device (CT clamp) was installed, this shows how much electricity your home is using. This helps you understand how much of your solar energy you're using vs. sending back to the grid.

### Net Energy
The difference between what you produce and what you consume. Positive = you're sending energy to the grid. Negative = you're pulling energy from the grid.

### System Health
Shows the status of each microinverter and your IQ Gateway. Green = operating normally. Orange or Red = attention needed.

## Common Questions

### "Why does my production drop to zero at night?"
Solar panels only generate electricity from sunlight. Zero production at night is completely normal.

### "Why is my production lower on cloudy days?"
Cloud cover reduces the amount of sunlight reaching your panels. Production will naturally be lower on overcast days but your system is still generating some energy.

### "Why does my app show no data?"
This usually means the IQ Gateway has lost its Wi-Fi connection. See our [Enphase IQ Gateway Troubleshooting](enphase-gateway-troubleshooting.md) article for steps to reconnect.

### "Can I share access with my spouse or family?"
Yes. In the Enlighten app, go to **Settings > Manage Users** and add additional users by their email address.

## Tips for Getting the Most from Monitoring

1. **Check your app weekly** to make sure your system is producing as expected.
2. **Compare monthly production** to your utility bill to see your savings.
3. **Set up alerts** in the app to receive notifications if your system encounters an issue.
4. **Use the consumption data** to identify opportunities to shift energy usage (like running the dishwasher or laundry) to peak solar production hours.
