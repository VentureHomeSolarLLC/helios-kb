# IGS Energy Community Solar FAQ

## What Is Community Solar?

Community solar allows you to benefit from solar energy **without installing anything on your home**. Instead of panels on your roof, you subscribe to a portion of a large solar project built in your community. The energy produced by that project is purchased by your electric utility, and you receive guaranteed savings on your electric bill.

## How Does It Work?

1. **You subscribe** to a share of a community solar project through IGS Energy.
2. **The solar project generates electricity** and feeds it into the local utility grid.
3. **Your utility applies credits** to your electric bill based on the energy your share produced.
4. **IGS Energy bills you** for the subscription at a rate that guarantees savings — typically up to 10% less than your standard electric costs.

**Nothing is installed on your home.** Your utility service stays exactly the same.

## Common Questions

### "How much will I save?"
You can save up to **10% on your electric supply costs**. Your exact savings depend on the size of your subscription (based on your annual electric usage) and the solar project's production. Expect higher credits in summer (more sunlight) and smaller credits in winter.

### "Do I need to change my utility?"
No. You keep your existing utility company. IGS Energy notifies your utility on your behalf when you enroll. Credits are applied automatically to your bill — no action needed from you.

### "What will change on my utility bill?"
Once your community solar project is live, you'll see:
- **Credits** appearing on your monthly utility bill (reducing your total)
- **A subscription fee** from IGS Energy, which may appear as a line item on your utility bill or as a separate bill from IGS

The subscription fee is always less than the credits you receive, so you save money every month.

### "Is there anything installed at my home?"
No. That's the beauty of community solar. There are no panels, no wiring, no construction at your property.

### "What if I move?"
Your account is connected to your **meter number**, not your name. If you move:
- Contact IGS Energy before your move
- If your new home is in the same project area, you can keep your subscription
- If you're moving out of the area, IGS will transfer or cancel your subscription with **no fees or penalties**

### "How long is the agreement?"
The standard agreement with IGS Energy is for **20 years**.

### "Can IGS change my subscription amount?"
Yes, but only to benefit you:
- If your usage is higher than expected, they may **increase** your subscription to maximize your savings (at no extra cost).
- If your usage is lower than expected, they may **decrease** your subscription so you're not over-allocated.
- Significant changes require a new agreement, and IGS will reach out to you first.

### "Is this available in my state?"
Community solar availability depends on state programs. Contact Venture Home to find out if community solar through IGS Energy is available in your area.
