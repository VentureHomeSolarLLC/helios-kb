# Sunnova to SunStrong Transition FAQ

## What Is Happening?

SunPower, one of the largest solar companies in the U.S., went through a restructuring. As a result, some customer service and warranty obligations for SunPower-installed systems have been transferred to **SunStrong**, a joint venture between SunPower and Sunnova.

If you received communication about this transition, this article explains what it means for you.

## What Does This Mean for Me?

### Your Solar System
Your solar panels and equipment are **not affected**. Nothing about your physical system is changing. Your panels will continue to produce energy exactly as they have been.

### Your Agreement
If you have a lease or PPA through SunPower/Sunnova, your agreement terms remain the same. The only thing that may change is who you contact for billing or service.

### Your Warranty
Equipment warranties remain in effect. SunStrong has assumed responsibility for honoring warranty claims on systems that were previously serviced by SunPower.

### Your Billing
Your monthly payment amount and billing terms remain unchanged. You may notice a change in the billing entity name (from SunPower to SunStrong or Sunnova), but the amount owed stays the same.

## Common Questions

### "Do I need to do anything?"
In most cases, no. The transition happens automatically. If any action is required on your part, you will receive direct communication from SunStrong or Sunnova.

### "Who do I contact for service now?"
- **For billing questions:** Contact Sunnova at **(866) 786-6682**
- **For system service or repairs:** Contact Venture Home at **(203) 858-3051**. As your original installer, we are still your point of contact for any service needs.

### "Will my monitoring still work?"
Yes. If you use the SunPower monitoring app, it should continue to function. If you experience any issues, contact SunStrong support or Venture Home for assistance.

### "What if I have a warranty claim?"
Contact Venture Home first. We will coordinate with SunStrong/Sunnova on your behalf to process warranty claims and schedule any necessary service visits.

### "Is my contract still valid?"
Yes. Your lease, PPA, or loan agreement is a legally binding contract that transfers with the business. Your terms, rates, and duration remain unchanged.
