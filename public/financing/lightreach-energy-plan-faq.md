# LightReach Energy Plan FAQ

## What Is the LightReach Energy Plan?

The LightReach Energy Plan (by Palmetto) is a solar lease/PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) that allows you to go solar with **no upfront cost**. Instead of purchasing your solar system outright, you pay a fixed monthly rate for the energy it produces — typically lower than what you'd pay your utility company.

## How Does It Work?

1. **Venture Home installs the solar system** on your roof at no cost to you.
2. **Palmetto (LightReach) owns the system.** They handle all equipment costs, warranties, and maintenance.
3. **You pay a fixed monthly rate** for the energy produced by the system. This rate is typically lower than your current utility rate.
4. **You keep your utility account.** You'll still receive a utility bill for any energy you use beyond what the solar system produces.

## Common Questions

### "Do I own the solar panels?"
No. Under the LightReach Energy Plan, Palmetto owns the solar equipment. You are purchasing the energy the system produces at a locked-in rate. This means you don't qualify for state or federal tax incentives (those go to the system owner), but you also don't have any maintenance responsibilities.

### "What happens if the system needs repairs?"
Palmetto is responsible for all maintenance and repairs for the life of the agreement. If something breaks, contact Venture Home and we'll coordinate the repair at no cost to you.

### "What happens if I sell my home?"
You have two options:
1. **Transfer the agreement** to the new homeowner. The buyer takes over your LightReach payments.
2. **Buy out the system** at the current fair market value and include it in the home sale.

Most buyers are happy to take over the agreement since it means lower energy bills from day one.

### "Will my rate increase over time?"
Your LightReach agreement may include a small annual escalator (typically 0–2.9% per year), which is outlined in your contract. Even with the escalator, your rate is designed to remain below projected utility rate increases. Check your specific agreement for your escalation terms.

### "How am I billed?"
You receive a monthly bill directly from Palmetto/LightReach for the energy your system produces. This is separate from your utility bill. You can set up autopay through the Palmetto customer portal.

### "What if the system produces more energy than I use?"
Excess energy goes back to the grid. Depending on your utility and state, you may receive net metering credits on your utility bill. However, your LightReach payment is based on total production, not consumption.

### "What happens at the end of the agreement?"
At the end of your agreement term (typically 25 years), you may have the option to:
1. Renew the agreement
2. Purchase the system at fair market value
3. Have the system removed at no cost

### "Can I monitor my system?"
Yes! Your solar system includes monitoring through the Enphase Enlighten app. You can track production, consumption, and system health in real time. See our [Enphase Enlighten Monitoring Setup](../enphase/enphase-enlighten-monitoring-setup.md) guide.
