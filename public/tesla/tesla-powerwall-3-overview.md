# Tesla Powerwall 3: What You Need to Know

## What Is the Tesla Powerwall 3?

The Tesla Powerwall 3 is a home battery system that stores energy from your solar panels. It provides backup power during grid outages and can help you save money by using stored solar energy instead of drawing from the grid during expensive peak hours.

## Key Specifications

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Usable Capacity** | 13.5 kWh |
| **Power Output (Continuous)** | 11.5 kW |
| **Integrated Inverter** | Yes — built-in solar inverter (no separate inverter needed) |
| **Backup Capability** | Whole-home backup (depending on loads) |
| **Warranty** | 10 years |
| **Dimensions** | 43.25" x 24" x 7.6" |
| **Weight** | 287 lbs |

## How It Works

### During the Day (Solar Production)
Your solar panels generate electricity. The Powerwall stores excess energy that your home isn't using in real time.

### During the Evening (No Solar)
When the sun goes down and your panels stop producing, the Powerwall automatically kicks in and powers your home using the stored energy.

### During a Grid Outage
If the grid goes down, the Powerwall detects the outage instantly and switches to backup mode. Your home continues to run on battery power. If your solar panels are still producing (daytime outage), they will continue to charge the Powerwall while also powering your home.

## Monitoring with the Tesla App

The Tesla app lets you monitor your Powerwall in real time:

- **Energy flow:** See where your energy is going — solar, battery, home, or grid.
- **Backup reserve:** Set how much battery capacity to keep reserved for outages.
- **Storm Watch:** When severe weather is forecasted in your area, the Powerwall automatically charges to 100% to prepare for a potential outage.
- **Time-Based Control:** Optimize when the Powerwall charges and discharges based on your utility's rate schedule.

### Download the Tesla App
- **iPhone:** [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/tesla/id582007913)
- **Android:** [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslamotors.tesla)

## Common Questions

### "How long will the Powerwall last during an outage?"
It depends on your home's energy usage. A single Powerwall 3 (13.5 kWh) can typically power essential loads (lights, refrigerator, Wi-Fi, phone chargers) for 12–24+ hours. Heavy loads like air conditioning or electric heating will drain the battery faster.

### "Can I add more than one Powerwall?"
Yes. Multiple Powerwalls can be installed together to increase your total storage capacity and backup duration.

### "Does the Powerwall work without solar panels?"
Yes, the Powerwall can charge from the grid and provide backup power during outages even without solar panels. However, pairing it with solar gives you the ability to recharge the battery during extended outages.

### "What happens when the Powerwall is full?"
Once the Powerwall is fully charged, excess solar energy is sent back to the grid. Depending on your utility and state, you may receive credits for this energy (net metering).

### "Do I need to maintain the Powerwall?"
No. The Powerwall requires no regular maintenance. It is a sealed unit with no moving parts. Tesla monitors your system remotely and will alert you if any issues are detected.

## Troubleshooting

### Powerwall Not Charging
1. Check the Tesla app — is the system in the correct mode? (Self-Powered or Backup Only)
2. Verify your solar panels are producing energy (check during daylight hours).
3. Restart the Powerwall by toggling the on/off switch on the unit.
4. If the issue persists, contact Venture Home.

### Tesla App Shows No Data
1. Ensure your home Wi-Fi is working and the Powerwall/Gateway is connected.
2. Try force-closing and reopening the Tesla app.
3. Restart your Gateway (if applicable) by turning off its breaker for 30 seconds, then turning it back on.
4. Contact Tesla support at **(877) 798-3752** or Venture Home at **(203) 858-3051**.

### Powerwall Not Providing Backup During Outage
1. Check your backup reserve setting in the Tesla app — if it's set to 0%, the battery may have been fully discharged.
2. Ensure the Powerwall's main breaker is ON.
3. Contact Venture Home for a diagnostic visit.
