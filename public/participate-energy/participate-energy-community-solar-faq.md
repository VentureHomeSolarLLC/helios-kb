# Participate Energy Community Solar FAQ

## What Is Participate Energy?

Participate Energy is a community solar provider that partners with Venture Home to offer our customers access to solar savings — even if you can't install panels on your own roof. Through Participate Energy, you subscribe to a share of a local solar farm and receive credits on your electric bill.

## How Does Community Solar Work?

1. **You sign up** for a community solar subscription through Venture Home or Participate Energy.
2. **A solar farm in your area** generates clean electricity and sends it to the local utility grid.
3. **Your utility applies bill credits** to your account based on your share of the solar farm's production.
4. **Participate Energy bills you** for your subscription at a rate that's lower than your utility's standard supply rate — meaning you save money every month.

**No panels are installed on your home.** Your existing utility service remains unchanged.

## Common Questions

### "How much will I save?"
Community solar subscribers typically save **5–15% on their electric supply costs**, depending on the program structure in your state and the solar farm's production. Savings may vary seasonally — higher in summer months when solar production peaks.

### "What changes on my electric bill?"
You'll notice two things:
1. **Bill credits** from the community solar project, reducing your utility charges
2. **A separate bill or line item** from Participate Energy for your subscription fee

Your total combined cost (utility bill minus credits + Participate Energy fee) will be less than what you were paying before.

### "Do I need to do anything to my home?"
No. Community solar requires zero changes to your property. No installation, no roof assessment, no permits.

### "What if I'm a renter?"
Community solar is one of the best options for renters who want to benefit from solar energy. As long as you have your own electric utility account, you can subscribe.

### "What happens if I move?"
Contact Participate Energy before you move. Depending on where you're moving:
- If your new home is in the same utility service area, you may be able to transfer your subscription.
- If you're moving to a different area, your subscription can typically be canceled without penalty (check your specific agreement terms).

### "How long is the commitment?"
Agreement terms vary by program and state. Typical commitments range from **no long-term commitment** to **20 years**, depending on the specific community solar project. Your agreement terms are outlined in your enrollment documents.

### "Is this the same as buying solar panels?"
No. With community solar, you do not own any equipment. You're subscribing to a share of a solar farm's energy production. The benefit is guaranteed savings with no upfront cost, no maintenance, and no installation required.

### "Can I have rooftop solar AND community solar?"
In some states and utility territories, yes. However, the financial benefit may be limited if your rooftop system already covers most of your electric usage. Contact Venture Home to discuss what makes sense for your situation.
