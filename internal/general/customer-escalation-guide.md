# Customer Escalation Guide

> **Internal Use Only** — This document is for Venture Home employees and agents.

## Escalation Tiers

### Tier 1: Self-Service
The customer can resolve the issue on their own with guidance from our public KB articles.

**Examples:**
- Reconnecting Gateway to Wi-Fi
- Understanding their utility bill
- Setting up monitoring app
- Basic FAQ questions

**Action:** Direct the customer to the relevant KB article and follow up within 24 hours to confirm resolution.

### Tier 2: Agent-Assisted
The issue requires Venture Home involvement but can be resolved remotely.

**Examples:**
- Checking system status in manufacturer portals
- Initiating warranty claims
- Contacting financing companies on behalf of the customer
- Explaining billing discrepancies

**Action:** Handle the request, document in Forge, and update the customer within 24 hours.

### Tier 3: Field Service Required
The issue requires a technician to visit the customer's property.

**Examples:**
- Gateway hardware failure (4 red lights)
- Microinverter replacement
- Roof leak investigation related to panel mounting
- System not producing power

**Action:** Create a service ticket in Forge, coordinate scheduling with the field team, and confirm the appointment with the customer.

### Tier 4: Executive Escalation
The customer is dissatisfied with the resolution process or the issue involves legal, financial, or reputational risk.

**Examples:**
- Customer threatening legal action
- Media/social media complaints
- Repeated unresolved issues
- Property damage claims

**Action:** Immediately notify a manager (Tom O'Hearen or Alex). Do not attempt to resolve independently. Document everything.

## General Rules

1. **Respond within 4 hours** during business hours (9 AM – 6 PM ET, Monday–Friday).
2. **Never promise a specific resolution timeline** unless you've confirmed it with the service team.
3. **Always document interactions** in Forge. If it's not in Forge, it didn't happen.
4. **Be empathetic but honest.** If we made a mistake, own it. If the issue is outside our control (utility, financing company), explain that clearly.
5. **Follow up proactively.** Don't wait for the customer to chase you.
