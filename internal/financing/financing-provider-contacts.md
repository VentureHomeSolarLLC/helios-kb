## General Notes

- Always verify the financing type before advising a customer on transfers, payoffs, or modifications.
- For TPO/lease customers: Venture Home does NOT own the system. Defer ownership questions to the financing company.
- For loan customers: the homeowner owns the system but has a lien. Loan must be satisfied before clear title transfer.
- Document all financing-related customer interactions in Forge.
