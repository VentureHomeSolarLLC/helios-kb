## Warranty Coverage Summary

| Equipment | Warranty Period | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| IQ Microinverters | 25 years | Defects in materials and workmanship |
| IQ Gateway / Envoy | 5 years | Defects in materials and workmanship |
| IQ Batteries | 10 years (or 70% capacity) | Defects + capacity guarantee |
| IQ Combiner | 5 years | Defects in materials and workmanship |

## When to Initiate a Warranty Claim

- Customer reports 4 flashing red lights on Gateway (hardware failure)
- Microinverter consistently not reporting after standard troubleshooting
- Battery capacity has degraded below 70% of rated capacity within warranty period
- Physical defect or damage from manufacturing (not from external causes)

## Process

### Step 1: Verify the Issue
1. Ask the customer to perform basic troubleshooting first (see public KB article).
2. Check the system remotely in Enlighten (if you have installer-level access).
3. Confirm the serial number and installation date to verify warranty eligibility.

### Step 2: Contact Enphase
- **Installer Support Line:** (877) 797-4743 (select installer/partner option)
- **Online:** [installer.enphase.com](https://installer.enphase.com) — submit a warranty claim through the portal
- Provide: System ID, serial number of failed equipment, description of issue, and any diagnostic data.

### Step 3: Receive Replacement Equipment
- Enphase will ship the replacement directly to Venture Home or to the job site.
- Typical turnaround: 3–7 business days.

### Step 4: Schedule Installation
- Coordinate with the customer to schedule the swap.
- Most Gateway or microinverter replacements take 1–2 hours on site.

### Step 5: Return Defective Equipment
- Enphase requires the defective unit to be returned within 30 days.
- Use the prepaid shipping label provided by Enphase.
- **Failure to return the defective unit may result in a charge.**

## Important Notes

- Always verify warranty dates before promising free replacement to customers.
- If the system is out of warranty, provide the customer with a service quote.
- Document all warranty claims in Forge under the customer's project record.
- Take photos of the defective equipment before removal.
